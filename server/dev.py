"""
Some context : 

if "<DEVFLAG_MASTER_CLIENT />" is enabled in the "devSettings" 
the client will send a "0x1E" packet instead of the normal "0x1f" packet
this code is just good enough to get the player loading in game nothing more 
i played around for a bit and activating this option dint seem to actually provide anything of value
this why i decided to stop here 

Note : attempting to change levels will break the game also attempting to use any of the buildings in "CraftTown" wont work
